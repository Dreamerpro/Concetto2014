                <p>
Poster sessions are a valuable means of promoting discussion, both within
Specified disciplines and across widely different research areas. A poster
should be able to stand-alone. A colleague should be able to determine the
Purpose, data and significance of a project simply by looking at and reading
the poster. Posters represent the complete idea or essence of a topic
through pictures, tables, graphs etc. on a sheet of specific dimension. It is
the representation of a new research designed for generating an active
discussion.
