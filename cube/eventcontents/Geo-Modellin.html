                <p>
            Geo-Modelling is basically a depiction of the inherent processes taking place
In the Earth surface as well as in the sub surface. It also essentially includes
the processes and the means of various geological activities like seismic data
acquisition, exploration & exploitation process and mechanisms of the subsurface
methods etc. Generally, it gives a broader perspective and the
different aspects of their geological applications.
