                        "Basic research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing."

Poster presentation is the presentation of any scientific research or an idea in the form of a poster. The aim of this event is to test the technical depth of knowledge along with the creativity and the presentation skills of the participants. A good poster is one which is appealing to the viewer and which is understood easily. Distribution of handouts describing in brief the idea of your theme is a good way to get your poster remembered and gives a better understanding of the poster.
