                <p>
          Efficient use of waste remains an unsorted problem in the world of engineering since decades. So here we present "JUNKYARD WARS" which presents you with an opportunity which is unique in itself to explore and enhance the technocrat in yourself. <br><br>
"JUNKYARD WARS" event is all about searching for the ultimate hands on team with great design minds who can churn out anything from heaps of scrap.<br><br>
              You just need to have loads of enthusiasm, tons of perseverance, tolerance to a high magnitude of dirt & grease, zeal of innovation and finally a great general knowledge about how things work.	<br>

              <strong> Problem Statement:</strong><br>  <br> The problem statement will be uploaded on the facebook page of Junkyard Wars. Stay tuned to our facebook page for further details: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/junkyardwarsconcetto14">https://www.facebook.com/junkyardwarsconcetto14</a> <br>
*	The event is a design & fabrication challenge where the teams will be tested on their ability to crack the problem and come up with solutions from the available junk given to them.<br>

*	The event consist of 3  rounds: <br><br>

<strong> Round 1:</strong><br><br>

*	Round 1 will be general tech written quiz through which the general ability of teams will be evaluated. <br><br><br>

<strong> Round 2:</strong><br><br>

*	It will unfold into technical team interview and teams are required to explain their design either on paper or on any design software.<br><br>

        
<strong>Round 3:</strong><br><br>
*	In this round the teams have to go for fabricating their design in the allotted time form the heap of junk made available to them as per the problem stated.<br>

*	All teams are expected to have a prior knowledge on the use of cutting and drilling devices that includes hacksaws, chisel, drilling kit etc.<br>
*	Teams must be able to explain the working mechanism involved in their model to the judges at the end.<br>
*	All the materials will be provided by the organizing committee. <br><br><br>
<strong>Rules and regulation:-</strong><br><br>
*	Participants must register as team.<br>
*	Each team consists of 4-6 members.<br>
*	Teams are expected to have a basic know how over working principles of kinematic links, designing software and fabrication works<br>

*	Teams found violating any rules will be disqualified.<br><br><br>


<strong>JUDGING CRITERION:- </strong><br><br>

Teams will be judged on the basis of neatness in their design and fabrication work, together with explaining the solution to the given problems. <br>
Judges Decision will be final and irrevocable.<br>
