                <p>
               Robots can be used to perform tasks which humans cannot easily achieve or which are deemed dangerous for humans to do .The concept of the competition is to build an amphibious manual robot which will be able to navigate on terrain as well as water .Students are expected to utilize their knowledge of physics to build a bot which can float as well as navigate in water and also be able to travel and navigate on land .

                <p>
             Design an amphibious Bot which is able to maneuver both on land and water.<br><br><br>
                    <strong>Rules : </strong><br><br>

1. A checkpoint will be a pair of flags position on the arena. Bot is required to pass through all the checkpoints.<br>

2. If in anyway Bot falls off from the arena or misses a checkpoint it will have to start from the last checkpoint.<br>

3. Scores will be decided on the basis of time taken to complete the entire length of the arena irrespective of the number of trials between two checkpoints.<br>

4. If in any case a checkpoint is missed negative points will be awarded.<br>

5.The time measured by the organizers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams. Time measured by the contestant by any means will not be considered for scoring.<br>

6.In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organizer's decision will be final and binding. The organizers reserve the right to any of the above rules as they deem fit. <br>

Changes in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the teams.<br><br><br>
                    <strong>Team Specifications:</strong><br><br>

1. A team can have maximum 6 members.<br>

2. Participating members should be undergraduate students from any technical institution.<br>

3.The team must bring all accessories required for the performance. Request for accessories from the organizers will not be entertained.<br><br><br>

 
<strong>Bot Specifications :</strong><br><br>
1. The maximum dimensions of the Bot allowed is 12 inch x 9 inch x 12 inch<br>

2.An external ac power supply (220V) will be provided, though the Bot can have it's own on board battery.<br>
