                <p>
              Robotics has found its use in almost every field of Engineering, Mineral 
Processing is one of them. Mining & Mineral Processing Industry has seen 
exponential growth in recent times. To meet the high standards, the industry has 
to come up with new and better technology for both faster and reliable mineral 
processing. The use of robotics has given the industries an upper hand in coping 
up with the increasing needs. The basic 3 steps include -
i) Exploration ii) Exploitation iii) Extraction
This event mainly focuses to test the efficiency of participating robots in these 
tasks.

<center><h3>Geo-Futsal</h3></center><br>
<p><Strong>Problem Statement:</Strong><br>
The bots will have to traverse rough terrain and score maximum possible goals 
within 5 minutes. There will be 7 minerals (in form of balls) in the arena namely 
Diamond, Sapphire, Topaz, Emerald, Amber, Jasper and Ruby in which putting 
Ruby into goal will need the bot to score one more goal within 30 seconds to get 
the points allotted to Ruby.<br><br>
<strong>Rules:</strong><br><br>
1. The balls can only be pushed to goal.<br>
2. No arm mechanism can be used in this level.Arena Specifications:<br>
1. The arena will be in the form of a rectangle 3.5m X 3 m.<br>
2. The arena will consist of several hurdles in the form of uneven 
surface, tremors, pebbles, obstructions etc.<br></p><strong><h3>Arena Specifications:</h3></strong>

                <p>Overall points scored will be taken into account for preparing the rank list.<br>
 Top 10 teams will qualify for the 2nd round.</p>
                <br>
               <strong>Round 2:</strong> <br>
Problem Statement:<br>
The bots will have to traverse on rough terrain and discover minerals. The 
minerals discovered need to be taken out from ground and then it must be sent to 
the processing plant. Then the bot has to drill holes in the walls that will be in the 
arena with in the allotted time. Finally, there will be wells where the bot is 
supposed to suck the fluid from it and pour it in the container. The allotted time for 
doing the above said is 3+2+1 minutes, the most versatile bot will win. 
<strong>General Rules:</strong><br>
1. The bot must have a proper picking, drilling and sucking mechanism.<br>
2. Arm mechanism may be used for transporting the Mineral (block) to 
the processing zone.<br>
3. Simple push mechanism for transportation will lead to deduction of 
points.<br>
4. Drilling should have rotating mechanism.<br>
5. Suction mechanism can be made from motors, syringes or pumps.<br>
<strong><h3>Arena Specification:</h3></h3></strong><br>
                <p>
1. Dimensions: 4m x 3m<br>
2. The arena will consist of rough terrain.<br>
3. The bot will have to traverse through obstacles.<br>
4. The processing zone will be shown in red colour.<br>
                    </p>
                <center><img alt="minero2" src="eventcontents/images/minero2.png"/></center><br>
                <p><strong>Point System:</strong><br>
1. For drilling a certain zone, 20 points will be awarded.<br>
2. For transporting a single block to the processing zone, 50 points will 
be awarded.<br>
3. For sucking out oil from a well, 50 points will be awarded.<br>
4. Points will be awarded according to the amount of minerals found 
inside the blocks.<br>
1 unit of Mineral A=50 Points<br>
1 unit of Mineral B=40 Points<br>
1 unit of Mineral C=30 Points<br>
1 unit of Mineral D=20 Points<br>
1 unit of Mineral E=10 Points<br><br>
For example, A team drills 4 zones, transports 2 blocks to the processing plant, sucks oil of 1 
well, and collects 2 units of Mineral A, 3 units of Mineral B, 1 unit of Mineral C, 5 units of 
Mineral D and 1 unit of Mineral E then the total points earned by the team will be, 
=(20x4)+(50x2)+(50x1)+(50x2)+(40x3)+(30x1)+(20x5)+(10x1)<br>
=80+100+50+100+120+30+100+10<br>
=590 <br>
