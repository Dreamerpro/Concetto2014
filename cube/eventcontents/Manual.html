            Robotics has found its use in almost every field of Engineering, Mineral Processing is one of them. Mining & Mineral Processing Industry has seen exponential growth in recent times. To meet the high standards, the industry has to come up with new and better technology for both faster and reliable mineral processing. The use of robotics has given the industries an upper hand in coping up with the increasing needs. The basic 3 steps include 
            i) Exploration ii) Exploitation iii) Extraction
            This event mainly focuses to test the efficiency of participating robots in these tasks.
