                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong> Case:</strong> <br><br>
1.	Most of the adult male members are addicted to alcohol or drug or gambling and spending most of the money from whatever little they earn thus depriving the basic necessities of other family members. Drugs and alcohol are consumed openly. Under the feats of alcohol, quarrelling using abusive and slang language, beating wife and children is a common daily affair in almost every household. Children very naturally and spontaneously get accustomed with, learn and start using such language and develop a violent and hostile attitude towards others which are often reflected in their behaviour with their siblings, playmates or classmates.<br>
<br>
2.	Usually, due to the prevalent tradition in slums, families treat girl child as burden and want to marry them off, as soon they reach their teenage. This disrupts the education of both girl and boy leading to high dropout rates in school. This leads to another family that is uneducated, and are going to face the same problem again. <br>
<br>
3.	In most cases the mother tongue of the migrated children is totally different from the medium of instruction followed in neighbouring schools where they are being admitted after migration because either of unavailability of such schools nearby or because of parental unawareness. These children faces problem in understanding what is being taught in school. However they cannot express these problems because the language spoken at home is different from the medium of instruction followed in school. This in turn affects their performance in school and they gradually losses their interest in studies and becomes irregular in attending school and finally gets dropped out. Of the total number of children of 6-14 years age group it was found that a little more than 50% were not going to any school either because they were never enrolled or because they have discontinued their studies and dropped out and 48.56% children were attending school or continuing their studies.<br>
<br>
4.	A large number of people don't own lands, which makes them ineligible for issuing any official document. This deprives them of any governmental facilities. They cannot own home, and are forced to live in their self-made slums which are on governmental lands and due to fear of being dispelled, they can't get toilets and basic facilities.<br>
<br>
5.	 A large number of children residing in slums are first generation learners and even in those cases where parents are just literate the children hardly gets any help from parents regarding studies at home. There is also a firm belief among slum dwellers that children cannot learn from school alone. They need additional support and the best option available is that of private tutor. This is again an economic burden on parents. Moreover the private tuition that they avail is of much inferior quality and as a result it hardly makes an improvement in their achievement level.<br>
<br>
6.	Whenever the family undergoes financial crisis, they young boys otherwise studying, choose to work and support the family. They take up small and low paying jobs like assisting the shopkeepers and other available things. Soon as this becomes their life, they lose interest in study and do not go back to complete their education. This makes the life of these young boys poor and miserable and they are not able to improve their living standard. <br><br>
