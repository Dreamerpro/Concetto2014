               <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
Welcome to the fascinating world of electrical and electronics circuits and discover the phase of your journeyâ€¦ In the area of E & E circuits, the occurrence of errors is common and is a complicated task to debug the errors in the circuits. Here we are providing opportunities for the students to express their talent in the field of E & E circuit debugging.

*	Each team can have a max of 2 members.<br>
*	This event will be conducted in 2 phases (prelims and Finals)<br>
*	Five teams will be selected after the prelims for circuit debugging.<br>
*	The finalists will be selected on time basis.<br>
*	Calculators are not allowed<br>
*	Decision of judges will be final<br><br>

<strong>Prelims:</strong><br><br>
Preliminaries will be a written test with 15 questions (objective types & circuits with a error in it) duration of the test is 30 min.<br><br>
<strong>Finals</strong><br><br>
This round will be of 10 questions which involves circuits of higher complexities. Time allotted for this will be 45 min.<br><br>

<strong> Judging Criteria:</strong><br><br>
*	 In the absence of complete debugging, the partial debugging will also be considered and the prizes will be distributed accordingly.<br>
*	1st & 2nd prize will be awarded.<br><br>
