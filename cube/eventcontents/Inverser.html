                <p>
              This is a one of its kind event in which the concepts and analytical thinking capabilities of participants will be put to test. With both the theory and practical parts at use, the knowledge and the excitement factor of this event will be very high. So are you ready?

              The event will be organized in two parts. The first would be the qualification round and the second would be the final event.<br><br>
<strong>Qualification Round:</strong><br><br>
A quiz would be conducted in order to shortlist the final teams. The quiz would be based upon the general knowledge about electronic devices and their components and design. It will ensure that only those teams which have a basic understanding about electronics engineering would qualify for the final round.<br><br>
<strong>Final Round:</strong> Inverser la Fabrication<br><br>
In the final event, all the teams would be provided with certain electronic device and their task would be to dissemble that device and then explain its basic functioning. This would require an analysis of the deviceâ€™s functions, design and operation. The event will have a time limit of 30 minutes.<br><br>
<strong>Rules:</strong><br><br>
*	Maximum members allowed in a team are THREE.<br>
*	All the tools required will be provided.<br>
*	Teams can register either by mailing TEAM NAME, MEMBERS NAME & CONTACT INFO to undersigned or by On-spot registration.<br>

               <strong> Inside the Event:</strong><br><br>
 <strong>About the final round:</strong><br>
We are considering 3-4 basic electronic devices, out of which we will select any one, which will be provided to the teams. The devices which are under consideration are:<br><br>
1.	Radio:<br>
Description.<br>
Here is the circuit diagram of a simple radio that uses one transistor and few other passive components.The C6 and L1 forms a tank circuit which picks up the signal from your desired radio station.Diode D1, capacitor C2 and resistor R1 does the detection of the picked signal.The detected signal is coupled to the base of Q1 through capacitor C3.The Q1 gives required amplification to the signal.The resistor R2 is used to bias Q1.R3 limits the collector current of Q1.The audio output will be available at the collector of Q1 and it can be heard by using a high impedance head phone.This radio will work only at places where there is  reasonable radio signal strength.<br>
