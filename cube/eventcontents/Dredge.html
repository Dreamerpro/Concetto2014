               <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
           Often during the cleaning process in ores, a lot of unwanted material like sand, stones and other non-biodegradable human waste etc. is mixed with minerals which need to be cleaned. <br>

"Dredge and drop" basically gives the idea about separation, carriage and storage techniques employed in mining.<br><br>
                   <strong>THEME:</strong> <br><br>

Participants are required to design bots which need <br><br>
*	to transport a specific quantity of material from one place to another<br>
*	to separate unwanted material like over burden (sand, rocks) from ore (minerals)<br>

                <h3><strong> STAGES OF VALIDATION:</strong></h3><br>
                <p>

<strong>ROUND 1:</strong><br><br>
*	In this round the bots have to simply transport sand from one place to another in a time span of 5 minutes.<br>
*	Ones’ which carry larger amount (among the appeared participants) are qualified for next round<br><br>

<strong>ROUND 2:</strong><br><br>
*	In this round, the bot shall have to travel across a slippery terrain and reach a destined position where there would be a closed pit, inside which, marbles and stones mixed with sand are buried.<br>
*	One’s bot had to uncover the sand and collect the marbles and stones.<br>
*	 The bot that’s mined, marbles to stones ratio and in total number is more in a permitted time (of 7 min) is considered as winner.<br><br>
 
<strong>BOT SPECIFICATIONS:</strong><br><br>
*	Size and weight of the bot should have a certain limit (not more than 20x30cm2 and 3kg respectively).<br>
*	If a conveyer belt is used then the length and width should not exceed 25cm and 8 cm respectively. (conveyer belt will be helpful in collecting minerals faster and easily)<br>
*	If a collector jar or box is used, max permissible volume is 20x15x10cm3. <br><br>

<strong>RULES:</strong><br><br>

*	Pit dimensions are 1.5m diameter and 0.5m depth <br>
*	Only 2 bots would be competing against one other simultaneously.<br>
*	The bot should be able to run over the sand.<br>
*	Power is supplied by us.<br>
*	Bots that are bought  directly from market are strictly prohibited<br>
*	The event organisers are not responsible for any type of electrical or mechanical damage to the bot.<br><br>

<strong>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</strong><br><br>
*	Open to all, in a team of three to five participants<br>
