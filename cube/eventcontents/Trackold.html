              Robots are the future. The future is in your hands now. A MNC FedEx is known in delivering the correct parcel to the customers in the minimum time. The company wants to optimise their delivery system and wants your autonomous bot to do it for them. Help them decode the destination and reach the postal address in least of the time!

Problem statement<br>
Design an autonomous robot which can travel across a path with bridges and breakers to deliver the parcel at the coded address.<br><br>
Prelims:<br><br>
The autonomous robot has to traverse the track (containing a line to follow) present on roads and highways with breakers in minimum time.<br>
1.	Choose the direction as left when you read white on right wall and black on left wall and right when white on both walls.<br>
2.	Cross the bridges and breakers without toppling.<br><br>
Finals:<br><br>
The autonomous robot has to decode the address and go to the gate by finding out your way using wall signals and codes!<br>
The path will have a black line in middle to follow and breakers as hurdles.<br>
*	Postal code is to be read and saved and signal shall be black on right wall and the code will be on left wall. Black on right indicate you to read the code on left wall.<br>
*	White on right and black on left wall mean turn left.<br>
*	White on both wall should be used as only to reach the required gate. Donâ€™t worry of turning right in this level<br>

                  <h3>General guidelines</h3><br>
                <p>
              
*	Power supply should not exceed 12 V.<br>
*	Dimension of black strip will be 2 cm.<br>
*	Wall will be of dimension 5*10 cm sq.<br>
*	Angle of elevation of bridge shall be 15 degrees.<br>
*	The grid is made up of Black strips on a white background on the lower surface.<br>
*	Walls of the maze will be of black and white color with horizontal strip on path wherever there are walls.<br>
*	Walls will not be present everywhere but only at specific points.<br><br>
<strong>Bot specifications</stong></stong><br><br>
*	Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed. <br>
*	The autonomous bot must fit in a box of dimension 
200mm L x 200mm W x 200mm H<br>
*	Autonomous bot can have on-board or off-board power supply, a 220 Volt 50 Hz AC power supply plug will be provided by the organizers. However the teams are required to bring their own adapters or batteries with them. The maximum allowed voltage is 24V. <br>
*	The autonomous bot must be stable, and during the run can expand itself provided it does not damage the arena in anyway. However it is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any marks on the arena during the run. <br>
*	The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two or more units. All bots/units which are touching each other at the starting zone will be considered as one bot. <br>
*	The teams are allowed to use ready-made micro-controller boards/ready-made sensor kits. However the teams are not allowed to use ready-made Lego kits or any such assemblies. <br>
*	The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction. <br><br>
<strong>Team specifications</stong><br><br>
*	Each Team must consist of maximum 5 members.<br>
*	The team members can be from different institute and colleges.<br>
*	The decision of the judges will be final and binding.<br>
