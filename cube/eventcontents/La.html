                <p>
             It is 2015 and Wall-E and Eve are trying their best to save the seedling from the clutches of the evil robot Auto. Auto manages to steal the seedling and deactivate a robot as advanced as Eve, but he has no control over the primitive robots like Wall-E or the malfunctioning robots. It is now up to Wall-E to save Eve and return the plant to the captain of the ship. Little did he know that Auto had him right where he wanted. <br>

Wall-E ends up being trapped in a maze. Incidentally, the malfunctioning robots had somehow recaptured the seedling and they dropped it somewhere in the maze. They don’t know where but Wall-E must search as many places he can. Can Wall-E save Eve and find the seedling.

               <strong>Problem Statement </strong><br>
Build an autonomous robot that knows the maze and follows the wall, going throughcheckpoints to an exit. <br>

                    <strong>Rules</strong><br>
                    The bot is not allowed to leave anything behind during the run. It should not leaveany mark on the arena. Any bot found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified.

* A checkpoint will just be a ‘seedling’ maker on the ground. The robot is to just go over the checkpoints. However, it is not necessary to cover all checkpoints.<br>
* The participant are not allowed to touch the robot during its run through the arena. <br>
* Scoring will be done as best of three trials basis.<br>
* The time measured by the organisers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams. Time measured by the contestant by any means will not be considered for scoring. <br>
* In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organiser’s decision will be final and binding. The organisers reserve the right to any of the above rules as they deem fit. <br>
Changes in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the teams.<br><br>

<strong>Guidelines/Suggestions</strong>
Use atleast two IR obstacle sensors or ultrasound sensor facing either side so that it can detect the presence wall.<br>
* You can either choose to follow the wall or program your robot to take the shortest path possible.<br>
* Make your robot as small as possible so that it can make a full 360 ̊ turn if required.<br><br><br>

                    <strong>Team Specification</strong><br><br>
A team can have maximum 5 members.<br><br>
* Participating members should be undergraduate students from any technical institution. <br>
* The team must bring all accessories required for the performance. Request for accessories from the organisers will not be entertained.<br><br><br>

                    <strong>Robot Specification</strong><br><br>
                    Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed.<br><br>

* Apart from the 200mm x 200mm x 200mm size limit of the bot, care must be taken that it fits through the maze at turns.<br>
* The power supply to the autonomous bot must be on-board. <br>
* The teams are allowed to use ready-made micro-controller boards/sensor kits. <br>
However the teams are not allowed to use ready-made Lego kits or any such assemblies.<br>

<strong>Scoring </strong><br>
Score = 100 + (C x 150) + (E x 300) - (T x 40)<br>

Where,<br>

C = Number of checkpoints covered<br>

E = Reach Eve and Exit<br>

T = time required to exit in minutes<br>
