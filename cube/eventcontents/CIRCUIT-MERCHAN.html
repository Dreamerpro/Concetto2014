One of the reason that science is so prevalent is that it can be easily applied with other fields of study. Thus it becomes unimaginable to expect the results when one can apply their theoretical knowledge with business applicability. <br>
We give you a chance to discover and experience this in CIRCUIT MERCHANT which allows you to apply your practical instinct with all you have grasped in recent years.

                <p>
             <strong> Round 1:</strong><br><br>
                 
*	Participation in teams of two or three.<br> 
*	A written paper will be taken consisting of questions based on core electrical knowledge. <br> 
*	Based on merit, first 8 teams will be selected for next round.<br> 
*	The marks obtained will be converted to virtual money, which will be used by the team in next round.<br> <br> 
<strong>Round 2:</strong><br> <br> 
*	Selected team will be given a problem or situation based on which they have to design a circuit to solve the problem.<br> 
*	The components (wires, transistors, capacitors, etc) required for the construction of the circuit will be on sale, with a specific amount on them.<br> 
*	Teams have to buy the required components using their virtual money.<br> 
*	Teams can barter the components among themselves.<br> <br> 

The team successfully designing the circuit in minimum time will be declared the winner.<br> 
In case no team can complete the challenge, the decision shall lie in the hands of the judges.<br>
