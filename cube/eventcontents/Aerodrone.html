                <p>
          Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.<br>
<strong><i style="float: right"> - Leonardo Da Vinci</i></strong><br><br>
To most people sky's the limit but are you one of those who feel that the sky is their home? To those skyward bound people, for the first time, ISM Dhanbad brings to you Aerodrones, an opportunity for engineers and aero designers to put their skills and technicality to the test.<br>
For most people, the beauty of an airplane's design lies in its lines and curves. For the flier, however, the beauty of a design includes what that design can do. That feeling is as true for R/C (radio control) pilots as it is for pilots of full-size aircraft. Their differences—aircraft size, and the fact that R/C pilots remain on the ground-have very little impact on the way given designs perform.<br>
The time has come when you can prove you have that in you. This time in Concetto, we have come up with one of biggest R/C plane events: Aerodromes. Don't miss the glorious chance. Come and fly!!<br>

              <strong>  Problem Statement: The participants has to build radio controlled aircraft and complete the given task in each round.</strong><br><br>
<strong> First Round:</strong> <br>
In this round, the participants have to take off their planes from the take off/landing zone, encircle the pole in the middle of the arena and land the aircraft in the landing zone properly in the minimum time possible. The distance between the initial point and the pole will be 125 metres. Each team will be allotted 10 minutes. Timing will be the judging criteria. Half of the total participating teams will qualify for the final round.<br><br>

<strong> Second Round:</strong> <br>

This round will be a bit more challenging than the previous round. The participants will take off from initial point, horizontally encircle the pole and hit the Bull’s Eye on the landing Zone. Teams will be judged on the basis of their Bull’s Eye Point and minimum possible time taken.<br><br>
 
<strong> Final Round:</strong> <br>

 Crossing all the hurdles, teams are now in the final round. In this round, the task is to take off their planes, perform the given set of manoeuvres, and land the aircraft in the landing
zone properly. Teams have to complete the task within 5 minutes. For each of the manoeuvres performed, points will be awarded based on the smoothness and accuracy. The team getting the maximum points will be declared the winner.<br><br><br>

<strong>Rules and Regulations:</strong> <br><br>

1.	The event will be conducted at lower ground ISM Dhanbad and the teams are required to bring their aircrafts and all necessary equipments.<br>
2.	Maximum number of members in the team must not exceed five.<br>
3.	The timer will start from the moment the aircraft is in air and stops at the moment the aircraft stops moving after landing.<br>
4.	The ratio of thrust to weight should be 0.75, if excess thrust is found, it will be compensated by adding extra weight.<br>
5.	Decision of the judges shall be treated as final and binding.<br><br>

<strong> Model Specifications:</strong> <br><br>

1.	The RC aircrafts has to be built.<br>
2.	Only electric motors are allowed.<br>
3.	IC engine is strictly not allowed.<br>
4.	Electric motor should be of max capacity-1400kV.<br>
5.	The dimensions of the plane should not exceed 120 cm in any direction.<br>
