                    <strong> The event will involve two stages.</strong><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In the first stage participating team has to design a model of an ideal refinery with the help of 
material provided in the kit at the time of event. Participants are supposed to design the model 
in such a manner which can mitigate the challenges faced by the refineries. Emission of harmful 
gases, waste water treatment, geographical location, sustainability, conservation of energy, 
sulfur content etc. are the major challenges involved.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the second stage participating team has to give a presentation to describe their model. All the 
characteristic features involved in the design incorporating the above mentioned challenges
need to be explained in the presentation stage.<br><br>
&nbsp;<strong> Rules & Regulations:</strong><br><br>
1. Participating team will be of maximum four members.<br>
2. Designing kits will be provided at the time of event (*free).<br>
3. There will be a time limit to designing and presentation stage.<br>
