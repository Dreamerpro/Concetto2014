                <p>
            The competition provides a specific technical problem for a student team to solve. This activity is aimed at boosting the electronic design interest and capabilities among the students.We believe that the experience of designing a real-world system from scratch will stay with the finalists for a long time.

                <p>
       <strong> ROUND 1</strong>   <br> <br>
This will be a written elimination round consisting of questions related to electronic fundamentals and hardware. Question sheets (MCQ) will be provided to the registered teams on a particular time. They will have 30 minutes to solve the questions and submit the answer sheets.There will be no negative marking. 
             <br> <br>
   <strong> ROUND 2</strong>   <br> <br>
This will be a debug round. You will be provided a sheet having circuits on it.You have to debug the circuits in 30 minutes. After this round  teams will be  eliminated depending upon scores obtained in both 1st and 2nd round.
                     <br> <br>
  <strong> ROUND 3 </strong>   <br> <br> 
Part A- <br> <br>
Teams that will qualify after the second round will build (simulate) an application on given problem statement in Orcade/Proteus/Multisim software. The problem statement will be disclosed on the spot. 30 minutes will be given.
         <br> <br>
<strong>Part B-</strong>   <br> <br>
 After the successful simulation of design, you have to implement it on the breadboard using available components only in 45 minutes. All the components and required material will be provided to the teams.One hour will be given to each team. You must design the circuit by using the components provided by us. You may not use any other component/material.Teams should draw circuit diagram of the application depicting all the principles and theories involved in circuit as well as the working of the Application on a Chart Sheet.
Part A and Part B will carry equal weightage. <br>
                    </p>
