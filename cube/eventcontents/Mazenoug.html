               Problem Statement:<br>
Round 1: This round deals with just your speed. this round includes a maze which has four entry as well as four exit points(i.e 4 bots enter arena simultaneously). The bot of one participant should enter from one entry and exit from the oppsite corner and the same follows for the other three. The time limit for this round will be 2 minutes. amongst four,the two top scorers will go to the second round.<br>
Round 2: This round deals with both your speed as well as your skills. This round also includes a maze which has four entry as well as four exit points but with some buttons* in the arena which when stepped, will make a drastic transition in paths of ARENA. The bot of one participant should enter from one entry and exit from the opposite corner and the same follows for the other three. The time limit for this round will be 3 minutes. within four participants the two top scorers will go through to the third round.<br>
Round 3: This round deals now with  your speed and moreover your anger management skills. arena here is same as above but now the paths will atomatically be transiting from one phase to another . The bot of one participant should enter from one entry and exit from the one at the other corner and the same follows for the other three. The time limit for this round will be 5 minutes. There will be two participants claiming their win at the same time, in successive rounds the top scorer will be declared as the winner.<br>

Rules:<br>
*	There will be four* dots at different positions in the maze. The click on these dots(RED coloured) will provide the participants 25 points each. steeping on all the four dots will result in additional 50 pts to particitants.<br>
*	Exceeding time limit will result deduction in the points(1 point for each extra second).<br>
*	The maze arena will measure 9 ft by 9 ft, with the width of each path equal to 30 cm.<br>
*	Any damage to the arena will disqualify the participating team*.<br>
                    **The actual arena of the maze will be revealed just the day before the event.
