               <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
           Ever sat gazing at the marvels of engineering spread across the pages of history and wondered,<strong> "HOW do they that?"</strong> For a layman, they might be just another man made structure but we sincerely believe that an engineer in us knows or wants to know every single minute engineering detail that goes in its making. This event encourages you to use all your engineering skills and bring to life a bridge, your design, your own wonder!

                   <strong> Rules And Regulations For The Event</strong><br><br>
>  The event is open to all.<br>
>  The maximum team size is four.<br>
>  The structure has to be made with popsicle sticks(ice-cream sticks) and fevicol as adhesive. <br>
>  The decision of the CONCETTO Team shall be final and binding.<br><br><br>



<strong>Event Structure</strong><br><br>

> Round 1: Teams should submit an abstract on or before 17th october(till 12:00pm). <br>
>The abstract should contain all the necessary details regarding the the bridge and should contain the one sided truss design of the model on an A4 sheet. <br>
> Round 2: The structures made will be tested on the day of the event.<br><br><br>

<strong>Constraints</strong><br><br>
>Only popsicle sticks can be used of specified dimension(dimension will be given later).<br>
>Bridge dimension should be in specified limit<br>
 	length: 40-50 cm.<br>
	breadth: 8-11 cm.<br>
	height: 11-15 cm.<br>
>Bridge weight should not exceed 200 gm.<br>
>Maximum no. Of sticks that can be stacked together is three.<br>
>Only Fevicol can be used as adhesive, use of other adhesives may lead to disqualifications.<br>
> Sticks can be altered physically by cutting or notching at any angle.<br>
>The overlapping between two sticks should be more than 40%. <br>
>Maximum number of sticks that can stack together is three. <br><br><br>

<strong>TESTING:</strong><br><br>
>The bridge will be loaded on the mid span.<br>
>The minimum load will be 10 kg. The increment in the loads will be in steps of 2 kg up to failure.<br><br>

             <strong>      JUDGING:</strong> <br><br>
>First the structure will be reviewed to check if it violates any rules mentioned above. <br>
>The scoring of the structure will be based on performance as well as aesthetics. <br>
>The bridge will be scored on how well the material has been used to support the load. The efficiency will be calculated as the ratio of ultimate load capacity and the bridge weight. <br>
> The bridge will also be scored on aesthetics. The event organisers will judge the bridge based on the detail to connections and members, the uniqueness of the design and its overall look. <br>
> The deflection of the bridge at yielding will be noted. If the deflection increases more than 10 mm, then the load at that deflection will be taken as the ultimate load. <br>
> Scoring Criteria <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Deflection at yield (d) = 20% <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Efficiency (e) = 50% <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Aesthetics (a) = 30% <br>
Total Score (S) = d + e + a <br><br>
Violating any of the conditions mentioned underneath, penalty will be imposed according to the event organisers and may lead to disqualification: <br><br>
> Weight exceeds the limit (Penalty of 20% of the total score). <br>
> Dimensional specifications are not met (Penalty of 10% of the total score) .<br>
> Use of material, except the ones stated in rules (Penalty of 50% of the total score or can lead to disqualification as decided by the event organisers).<br><br>

Failure is defined as:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Any physical failure.
