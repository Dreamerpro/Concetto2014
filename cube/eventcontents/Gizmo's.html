                <p>

Here you are with the opportunity to test yourself for situations like this. <br>
It is an on the spot event based on graphical software,which will be a surprise, with lots of 
brain exercise required which will be increased in subsequent rounds.The participants will be asked to make several 3D figures using 
the software by opting the best possible tool provided in that software.<br>
All that is required is your imagination capabilities, sharpness of mind and decisison making potentials.
