               <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
           Robo Trilogy as the name suggests has three events which will be held simultaneously. The 
room will be divided into 3 parts and all of the three events will be held in each of their 
respective parts simultaneously. One team will participate in only one event at a time. After 
they are done with a particular event, they move on to the next event and the next team fills in 
the their place. Hence, the events operate in a cyclic manner. The waiting teams will be sitting 
in the next room in the order in which they've been registered and meanwhile they will be 
taught about the Rubik's cube. The final winner will be declared based on the total number of 
points earned by the teams in each of the rounds.

prevent this. <br>
* There will be 8 balls placed at various positions in the attacking bot's side (green area).<br>
* The attacking bot must kick the balls into goal post without crossing a dead line (red line
