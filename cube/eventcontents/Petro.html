               When we face any kind of problem, the solution always arises with analysis of the circumstances we are involved in. So here comes a chance to shake your grey matter and show off your creative and analysing skills! 
Petrogaia 2014 presents Petro Panacea, a productive and dynamic case study competition which provides the opportunity for teams coming from various colleges to learn from and compete against different participating colleges, in a domain empowering teamwork, harnessing competitiveness and enhancing innovative ideas. 
The main goal of this event is for students to display their innovative skills to analyse the real challenges faced in the Petroleum Industry and provide constructive solutions for them.
The problem statement will be posted in the Concetto website.
