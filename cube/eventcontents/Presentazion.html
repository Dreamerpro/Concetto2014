                <p>
Presentazione is the paper-presentation competition organised by Dept. of Applied Geology. It is a valuable means of promoting discussion, both within specified disciplines and across widely different research areas. A paper should be able to stand-alone. A colleague should be able to determine the purpose, data and significance of a project simply by looking, reading and listening to the presentation. Papers represent the complete idea of or essence of a topic through pictures, data, tables, graphs etc. on a power point presentation. It is the representation of a new research designed for generating an active discussion.
